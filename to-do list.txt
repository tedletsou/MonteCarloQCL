There are many steps...

add goal dates for timeline

(1) Initialization modules
(2) Find space-charge
(3) Solve the Poisson equation
(4) Solve the Schrodinger equation
(5) Copy wavefunctions
(6) Calculate form factors
(7) Find Fermi levels
(8) Calculate phonon rates
(9) e-e rates
(10) Photon rates
(11) Rate equations (density matricies?)
(12) Final equations

Added header file for ParseInput.  Function now returns a struct to be used by GenerateZSpace (which will be used to populate simulation with material parameters).

Make sure to turn OFF DROPBOX SYNCING before trying to compile.  Seems to be serious conflicts between VS2019 and Dropbox.

I'm able to parse a data file (poorly?).  It seems like I will need to add hole effective masses in order to properly calculate Fermi levels.  Although, this is not an urgent issue.

Also need to add permittivity values.

Have to figure out how to populate z-space non-uniformly depending on meshing density input.

Functions in Cpp??? How to save variables over several files???

Set default number of periods to 3 
-add z-point at every interface change (going from barrier to well)
-populate equal number of points between each interface change
-find a way to identify barriers and wells after meshing is complete (look at MATLAB bandstructure calculation, I think QCL_solver_Ted)

THEN populate effective masses (both holes and e) and permittivities at each node.
